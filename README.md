# Library Management System 

## Description
This is a Java-based **Library Management System** developed as part of the Elevate Labs Java Developer Internship (Task 3).  
The system allows users to add, view, issue, and return books using a menu-driven console interface.

It demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as:
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance (conceptually)
- Polymorphism (method overriding)
